# Rover Go

A proof of concept re-writing Rover in Go

Uses [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) to provide the framework for a robust and familiar CLI tool and [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) for configuration

# Current status

### â˜¢ This should be considered spike / poc / investigation grade code

The rover "clone" command has been implemented as a test of the effort.
External command integration & execution is done via `pkg/command/command.go`

The "landingzone" command has been split into "run" and "list" sub-commands
The "run" sub-command currently can perform init, plan and apply and also connect to remote state. It uses [hashicorp/terraform-exec](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-exec) to interface with the terraform CLI

The `.rover.yaml` config file is used for all config and also holds remote state (backend) details for Terraform, as this includes storage access keys it's kept out of git. See the `.rover.sample.yaml`

This file needs to be located where `rover` is executing or in your home directory

# Example outputs from the CLI

```
$ ./rover
